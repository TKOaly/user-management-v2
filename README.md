# New user management for TKO-Ã¤ly

## Using

* Configure user-service to run locally.
* Fill in some configurations in config.ts.
* `yarn install`
* `yarn watch` for development. You need to manually refresh the site when nodemon has rebuilt the dist files.


For production, running `yarn start` should be enough.

## Improvements

1. Reload websocket connection during development
2. ESLint and prettier
